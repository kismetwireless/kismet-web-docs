  notes: |
    Due to changes in Trixie about the enforcement of GPG signing keys, if you have
    already installed the Kismet signing key previously, you will need to remove the
    kismet-release.gpg.key file and download it again:

    <code>sudo rm /usr/share/keyrings/kismet-archive-keyring.gpg</code>

    and re-download the key with:

    <code>wget -O - https://www.kismetwireless.net/repos/kismet-release.gpg.key --quiet | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/kismet-archive-keyring.gpg &gt;/dev/null</code>

  distro: "Ubuntu Bionic (18.04)"
  platforms: ["i386", "amd64"]
  name: "Ubuntu Bionic (18.04)"
  key: "bionic"
  builds: ["release", "git"]
  notes: |
    Due to limitations in the packages and versions of libraries in Ubuntu Bionic,
    these packages do not contain all features.  You may be able to manually install
    new versions of the required libraries and compile from source, instead.

    The following features are not available in Bionic packages:

    * Remote capture via websockets

      A Bionic install cannot function as a remote capture node feeding a Kismet server
      over websockets.

      TCP mode is still available.

      A Bionic Kismet server supports receiving remote captures over websockets, only
      client-mode websockets are impacted.
