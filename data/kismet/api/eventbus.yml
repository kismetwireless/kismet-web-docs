    The Kismet `eventbus` is a push/publish system used inside Kismet where events 
    are transmitted between Kismet components.   The eventbus is a central system 
    for almost all asynchronous events in Kismet. 

    Events are used to publish when devices are detected, human-readable status 
    messages, datasource errors and state, alerts, and more.  

    The websocket eventbus API allows for push notification of selected events when 
    they occur.  The Kismet web UI uses the eventbus for populating the alerts widget, 
    message panel, GPS location widget, and more. 

    Any tool monitoring Kismet should use the eventbus API.

    Events are a `string::object` dictionary of values and content, and can contain 
    simple text data, or complex complete objects like device records. 
  uriparameters:
    -
      name: "user" 
      type: "string"
      required: false
      description: | 
        User to log in as; websockets do not support standard basic-auth, 
        cookies, or other header-based login methods.

        You must provide either `user` and `password` parameters, or an 
        API token or login session token via the `KISMET` paraeter.
    -
      name: "password" 
      type: "string" 
      required: false
      description: |
        Password associated with the login user. 

        You must provide either `user` and `password` parameters, or an 
        API token or login session token via the `KISMET` parameter.
    -
      name: "KISMET"
      type: "string"
      required: false
      description: |
        Kismet auth token or API key.

        You must provide either `user` and `password` parameters, or an 
        API token or login session token via the `KISMET` parameter.
  notes: |
    Kismet websckets will accept authentication as HTTP basic auth, Kismet 
    session tokens, API keys, or HTTP URI-encoded GET paramaters of the user 
    auth, session token, or API key. 

    Some tools (websocket) allow sending HTTP basic auth as part of the URI 
    via `http://user:pass@host:port/eventbus/events.ws`, however modern browser
    implementations do *not* support this, and websockets *must* be constructed 
    with `GET` URI paramters. 

    Websocket URIs *must* match the content type of the calling page.  A `https` 
    page *must* use `wss` and a `http` page *must* use `ws`.  The Kismet UI 
    detects and handles this automatically via Javascript.
  apinotes: |
    The eventbus subscription API accepts JSON objects requesting a subscription topic 
    and optional [field simplification](/docs/api/command_param/#field-simplification). 

    Currently consumers are limited to *one* subscription *per topic*; it is not 
    possible for a single connection to subscribe to the same topic twice with 
    different field selections.  Multiple websocket connections from the same 
    client may subscribe to the same topic with different field selections without 
    restriction, however.
    
    An eventbus JSON command contains:

    {{< kismet_api_param name="SUBSCRIBE" type="string" required=false >}}
      Topic to subscribe to (from the list below), case sensisitive. One of either `SUBSCRIBE` or `UNSUBSCRIBE` is required.
    {{< /kismet_api_param >}}

    {{< kismet_api_param name="UNSUBSCRIBE" type="string" required=false >}}
      Topic to unsubscribe from, case sensisitive. One of either `SUBSCRIBE` or `UNSUBSCRIBE` is required.

      If the topic has not been subscribed to, this message will be ignored.
    {{< /kismet_api_param >}}

    {{< kismet_api_param auto="fields" >}}{{< /kismet_api_param >}}
    
    Either a `SUBSCRIBE` or `UNSUBSCRIBE` must be provided with each command.
    
    Once subscribed to a topic, an eventbus receiver will be sent a websocket text message containing the JSON record for each event which matches that subscription, optionally simplified.
    
    #### Eventbus topics
    
    Eventbus topics may be dynamically expanded by plugins, external helper tools, and more.  Some topics are used predominately as internal messaging mechanisms between components of Kismet, while others are generated at regular intervals specifically for consumption by external UI and monitoring systems.

  example: |
    Constructing and connecting a websocket uses the standard Javascript websocket 
    API: 

    ```javascript 
    var ws = new Websocket('ws://host:2501/eventbus/events.ws?'
      'user=username&password=password');
    ws.onmessage = function(msg) {
        var json = JSON.parse(msg.data);
        console.log(json);
    }
    ws.onopen = function(event) {
        var req = {
            "SUBSCRIBE": "TIMESTAMP"
        }
        ws.send(JSON.stringify(req));
    }
    ```
