    Returns devices which have been active (traffic observed from the device address) 
    since the supplied timestamp.  

    Timestamps can be absolute or relative. 

    This endpoint is most typically used to repeatedly monitor recent devices, but 
    can be replaced with the more efficient push-style device monitoring websocket below 
    for many use cases.

    Fetch devices which match the supplied MAC address. 

    It is possibkle (though usually not likely) that there may be MAC address collisions 
    between different PHY types.  This becomes more likely when using either non-Wi-Fi 
    datasources which synthesize completely artificial MAC addresses for indexing 
    when no actual MAC address is available (such as RTL-433, ADSB, and other SDR 
    based datasources), or when capturing two wireless devices from the same 
    physical component, like a combo Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.

    Devices can be monitored in realtime using the device monitor websocket API, which will push device 
    changes to listeners as they occur. 

    By subscribing to devices, or groups of devices, a client can receive a push event of the device 
    record.  

    The device data pushed can also be simplified by the standard [field simplification](/docs/api/command_param/#field-simplification). 
  apinotes: |
    The device monitoring subscription API accepts JSON objects with a subscription or removal request 
    for a device or group of devices specified by [key, MAC, or group MAC](/docs/api/keys_and_macs),
    and optional [field simplification](/docs/api/command_param/#field-simplification). 

    #### Subscription API 
    {{< kismet_api_param name="monitor" type="string" required="true">}}
      Device identifier specified by key, MAC, or group of MACs with a masking value, as defined in [Keys and MACs](/docs/api/keys_and_macs)
    {{< /kismet_api_param >}}

    {{< kismet_api_param name="request" type="number" required="true">}}

  deprecated: |
    While still available for legacy code, this API has been deprecated 
    in favor of the [device view API](/docs/api/device_views/) `all` view.
  methods: ["GET", "POST"]
  roles: ["readonly"]
  docs: |
    The device summary API is the base API beneath a scrollable view of 
    devices Kismet is tracking. 

    It is designed to be connected to a jquery-datatables view, but can be used by 
    any UI mechanism with a concept of a scrolling sub-view. 

    Whenever possible, a UI is *highly* encouraged to use a scrolling window mechanism 
    to view the devices:  Kismet can track tens or hundreds of thousands of devices,
    and trying to render them all as a single view will likely over-tax both the 
    Kismet server and whatever is rendering the UI.

    When in datatables mode (`datatable` set to `true` in the JSON argument), this API 
    takes additional `FORM` variables from the jquery-datatables implementation.
