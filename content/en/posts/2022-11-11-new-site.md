Welcome to the new Kismet site! 

The new site design comes via [hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [Doks](https://getdoks.org/) theme. 

There's also a pile of templating to make as much of the documentation consistent and clear, with all 
of the developer API documentation converted to YAML data and rendered through the template engine.

The docs data files will be added to the [Kismetwireless github](https://github.com/kismetwireless/) 
mirrors soon.
