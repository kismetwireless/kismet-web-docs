## 2025-09-R1

It having been far too long since a full release, and with a large backlog of
improvements and fixes, it's well past time to call it a release and fix
whatever new bugs have arisen and start working on new improvements and
features.

## Biggest changes

* A new table display library in the UI adds more reliable pagination, sizing,
  and display.  Columns can be added, removed, resized, and rearranged in the
  main display panel directly.  The display is much more efficient, and
  shouldn't exhibit the strange sizing behavior which happened sometimes.
* Python dependency removed for all datasources.  Python keeps changing the
  asyncio syntax and making other small breaking changes, making packaging
  Python based tools outside of `pip` problematic to say the least.  RTLSDR and
  similar sources are now rewritten in pure C.
* All new datasource/ipc protocol.  This replaces the protobufs based protocol,
  removes another complex library dependency, and adds speed enhancements.
* Lots of improvements to reduce RAM and CPU use, especially in the fastest
  packet processing paths.

## Upgrading

Upgrading should be as simple as other releases - just make sure to install the
datasource tools; `make install`, the Kismet site packages, and all known
distribution packages should take care of this automatically.

The rewritten pure-C datasources replace the legacy Python versions.  If
manually installed, the old sources should be removed; if installed via the
Kismet site packages, the new `_v2` versions of the packages should
automatically flag the original versions as incompatible and mark them for
uninstallation, but if the legacy packages remain installed they should be
manually removed.

Remote datasources should be upgraded at the same time as Kismet for maximum
functionality and compatibility.

Legacy remote capture sources should still work, so long as Kismet is compiled
with protobufs support.  The packages from the Kismet site are compiled to link
to protobufs, but distributions may choose to drop protobufs immediately - for
maximum compatibility, plan on upgrading remote datasources as well; the
efficiencies in the new protocol are worth it regardless!

## New stuff

* New UI list library (Tabulator), replacing Jquery Datatables and fixing a
  large number of weird display quirks which were unaddressable within
  datatables.  Adds dynamic column adding and positioning and smoother display
  and predictable row heights.
* ADSB parsed in the Kismet server instead of the datasource
* Additional Wi-Fi based drone fingerprints
* Add Pcap-NG UTF-8 JSON attribute under Kismet PEN
* Add geiger counter support for Radiacode over USB and Radview over Arduino
  serial
* Add AntSDR DJI DroneID source
* Device type icons in the UI
* Re-implement RTLADSB and RTL433 datasources in C, removing the need for Python
  after multiple incompatible Python version changes in the 3.x series
* Deprecate RTLAMR datasource - it can now be handled by RTL433 tuned to 915MHz
* Expand AP name parsing from IE tags for HP/Aruba, Mist, Ruckus,
  Aerohive/Extreme, Fortinet
* Add --version to datasources command lines to identify installed helpers
* Add version to datasource probe reports to identify local datasource binary
  versions
* Add version and remote connection type to remote datasources so help identify
  remote connections
* Google Protobufs now option, required only for the now-legacy V2 datasource
  protocol. Protobufs has been increasingly problematic to try to
  package and link and has introduced incompatibilities with the pure-C
  protobufs libraries.
* Start deprecating the V2 datasource/IPC protocol; compatbility remains to
  prevent desync with older remote datasources but all installs should be
  upgraded to the current remote and local datasources which have significant
  efficiency improvements.
* New V3 IPC protocol based on msgpack with smarter in-line decode which reduces
  memory copy load.  Built using a bundled msgpack library, removing the
  dependency on protobufs.
* SSIDCANARY alert for spotting specific networks

## Speed and RAM improvements

* Faster internal map for storing data (ankerl::unordered_dense)
* String cache for reducing RAM use
* Rewrite packet time comparison to remove a function call per packet
* Rewrite pcap-ng internal filter and component selectors to compile-time
  functors to eliminate a function indirection per packet
* Rewrite JSON name converstion to compile-time functor for speed
* Rewrite packet chain stages to eliminate std::function redirection and replace
  with compile-time functions
* Optimize all element cloning functions inside tracked elements
* Refactor use of smart pointers to reduce unnecessary pointer sharing and
  atomic increment/decrement in fast code paths
* Rewrite dot11 IE tag parsing to greatly reduce heap allocation and needless
  thrash
* Avoid constructing temporary strings in commonly used printable formatting
  functions
* Optimize datasource and entrytracker access for fast-path code
* Completely revamp IPC handling to reduce or entirely remove memory copies on
  incoming IPC data, using the new msgpack v3 protocol
* Rewrite all IO into a global buffer pool to reduce allocations and copies
* Remove copying of packet data during receive in the IPC, instead using a
  buffer pool and direct reading of the incoming packet from the IPC frame
* Rewrite and optimize the BPF filters for Wi-Fi capture
* Rewrite timer calculations to make events tick on predictable intervals,
  changing logic from ticking on tenth of a second after the last event, to
  ticking at one tenths of a second predictably
* Convert tracked field IDs to uint16 to save RAM - two bytes doesn't sound like
  much but there can be millions of tracked fields in a larger session

## Download

You can get the 2025-09-R1 release from [the Kismet downloads page](/download/#kismet-release),
where you can get both the source and packages for several distributions.

## Packaging

If you're looking to package Kismet, have a look at the [packaging guidelines](/docs/readme/packaging/).
For this release, I'd encourage maintainers to continue packaging protobufs and
the v2 protocol for now to make upgrading easier, before deprecating it fully
next release.

## Thanks

As always, a tremendous thank you to all the supporters on [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/kismetwireless)!
