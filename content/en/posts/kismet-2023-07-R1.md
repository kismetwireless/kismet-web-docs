## Kismet 2023-07-R1

Trying to get this out just before WWWD and Defcon, the hugely overdue next release of Kismet is here.

## Download

You can get the 2023-07-R1 release from [the Kismet downloads page](/download/#kismet-release), where you can get both the source and packages for several distributions.

# Changes and Updates

This release rolls in a number of fixes and improvements, collected over the past year, including:

* New dark mode in the web UI!

* New page-based device list in the web UI

  The old device list was always slightly odd & could get in states where the JS did not update as expected.  The new pager UI addresses this & brings a big performance boost.

* Fixes to channel listing

* Fixes to remote capture in some situations

* Optimizations to the field tracking system

* Improvements and fixes to WiFi 6e channel processing and numbering

* Fixes and general improvements to the order of operations when configuring WiFi interfaces on Linux for monitor mode

* Inclusion of the Hak5 WiFi Coconut userspace drivers and capture

* macOS builds via Brew

* Transition to using ephemeral JWT signing for login management instead of a state file

* Increased live censorship in the Web UI when ?censor=1 is passed

* Fixes to Python-based websockets not loading SSL contexts

* Upgrade a number of internal libraries for the Web UI and internals

  New graphing libraries

  New datatables version

  New robinhood hash

  Upgraded font-awesome

  Upgraded libfmt

  New moodycamel queue

* Fix long-standing bugs with field selection and summary in the API requests

* Add new display of thermal state on supported systems (linux)

* Revamp how rtl433 devices are mapped, split into sensors/meters/etc

* Handle power meter via rtl433

* Revamp sensor/meter UI to carry much more information

* Revamp IO system loops and locking patterns entirely to address hangs in some situations

* Add packet id and checksumming to pcap-ng exports

* Fix linux-capture-wifi following symlinks in /tmp

* Better NMEA handling

* Support libpcre2 now that pcre1 is deprecated

* Massive speed improvements in packet processing due to removal of dissection chain chokepoints

* Revamp of packet de-duplication system

* Add tx/rx packet counts per device

## Known issues

* Web UI may not scale properly on window size change

  Due to how the JS and table code calculates the size of the UI, it often does not scale properly when the window size changes (such as changing from internal to external monitor, etc).

  For now, this can be fixed by reloading the web page.
