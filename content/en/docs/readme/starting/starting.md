Kismet is launched from the command line, and can run headless (with no UI), but the typical way to interact with it is via the integrated web UI.

## Starting Kismet

The simplest way to start Kismet is to open a terminal and simply run it:

```
kismet
```

This will launch Kismet with the default configuration, and no pre-defined capture sources.

Assuming you have installed Kismet with suid-root (the recommended, more secure method) and your user is in the `kismet` group, you can now add sources via the web interface.

If you did *not* install Kismet suid-root, you will need to launch it as root with the `sudo` command, or it will not be able to control capture sources:

```
sudo kismet
```

Kismet will display information about the startup process, and any errors.

A typical startup from Kismet would look like:

Kismet will be verbose during startup; lines starting with `INFO` are meant to communicate configuration options and general state.  Lines which prevent Kismet from starting will be prefixed with `FATAL` and repeated as Kismet exits.
