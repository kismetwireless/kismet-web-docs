## Extending Kismet: Creating Capture Sources

Kismet supports additional capture types via the `KisDatasource` interface.  Data sources run in an independent process and can be written in any language, however they require a C++ component which functions as a Kismet driver to allow it to communicate with the datasource binary.

Datasources can report packets or complex records - if your datasource needs to pass parsed information about a device event, that's possible!

## Capture via IPC and Network

Kismet datasources communicate from the capture binary to the Kismet server via an IPC channel or TCP connection.  This channel passes commands, data, and other objects via an extension of the Kismet External API protocol; written using the Google Protobuf library, this protocol is extensible and parsers can be generated for nearly any language.

The datasource IPC channel is via inherited file descriptors:  Prior to launching the capture binary, the Kismet server makes a pipe(2) pair and will pass the read (incoming data to the capture binary) and write (outgoing data from the capture binary) file descriptor numbers on the command line of the capture binary.

Operating as a completely separate binary allows the capture code to use increased permissions via suid, operate independently of the Kismet main loop, allowing the use of alternate main loop methods or other processor-intensive operations which could stall the main Kismet packet loop, or even using other languages to define the capture binary, such as a Python capture system which utilizes Python radio libraries.

The network protocol is an encapsulation of the same protocol over a TCP channel, with some additional setup frames.  The network protocol will be more fully defined in future revisions of this document.

## The External Datasource Protocol

The datasource capture protocol acts as additional commands within the Kismet External API; it is defined in `protobuf_definitions/datasource.proto`.

Datasource commands are in the `KismetDatasource` namespace, and their string equivalents in the helper API are prefixed with `KDS`.  Reply-only frames are suffixed with `RESPONSE`.

## Defining the driver:  Deriving from KisDatasource

The datasource driver is the C++ component which brokers interactions between the capture binary and Kismet.

All datasources are derived from `KisDatasource`.  A KisDatasource is based on a `tracker_component` to provide easy export of capture status.

The amount of customization required when writing a KisDatasource driver depends on the amount of custom data being passed over the IPC channel.  For packet-based data sources, there should be little additional customization required, however sources which pass complex pre-parsed objects will need to customize the protocol-handling methods.

KisDatasource instances are used in two ways:

1. *Maintenance* instances are used as factories to create new instances.  A maintenance instance is used to enumerate supported capture types, initiate probes to find a type automatically, and to build a capture instance.
2. *Capture* instances are bound to an IPC process for the duration of capture and are used to process the full capture protocol.

At a minimum, new datasources must implement the following from KisDatasource:

*probe_type(...)* is called to find out if this datasource supports a known type.  A datasource should return `true` for each type name supported.

```C++
virtual bool probe_type(string in_type) {
    if (StrLower(in_type) == "customfoo")
        return true;

    return false;
}
```

*build_data_source(...)* is the factory method used for returning an instance of the KisDatasource.  A datasource should simply return a new shared ptr instance of its custom type.

```c++
virtual std::shared_ptr<kis_datasource>
    build_datasource(std::shared_ptr<kis_datasource_builder> in_shared_builder) {
        return std::make_shared<custom_kis_datasource>();

    };
```

A datasource which operates by passing packets should be able to function with no further customization:  Packet data passed via the `PACKET` record will be decapsulated and inserted into the packetchain with the proper DLT.

## Handling incoming packets

Generally, nothing needs to be done to handle incoming packets, the parent datasource definition will take care of it.  If, however, you receive packets which need modification before they are injected into the packetchain, you can override `handle_rx_datalayer(...)`:

```c++
void kis_datasource::handle_rx_datalayer(std::shared_ptr<kis_packet> packet,
        const KismetDatasource::SubPacket& report) {

    auto datachunk = packetchain->new_packet_component<kis_datachunk>();

    if (clobber_timestamp && get_source_remote()) {
        gettimeofday(&(packet->ts), NULL);
    } else {
        packet->ts.tv_sec = report.time_sec();
        packet->ts.tv_usec = report.time_usec();
    }

    if (get_source_override_linktype()) {
        datachunk->dlt = get_source_override_linktype();
    } else {
        datachunk->dlt = report.dlt();
    }

    packet->set_data(report.data());
    datachunk->set_data(packet->data);

    get_source_packet_size_rrd()->add_sample(report.data().length(), time(0));

    packet->insert(pack_comp_linkframe, datachunk);
}
```

Any implementation of `handle_rx_datalayer(...)` *MUST* implement the above framework, but may manipulate the DLT, timestamp, and contents of the `kis_datachunk` record in any way needed.

Similarly, `handle_rx_jsonlayer(...)` can be overridden to rewrite JSON non-packet records.

## Handling the PHY

Kismet defines `phy_handler` objects to handle different physical layer types - for example there are phyhandlers for IEEE802.11, Bluetooth, and so on.

A phy handler is responsible for defining any custom data structures specific to that phy, converting phy-specific data to the common interface so that Kismet can make generic devices for it, providing any additional javascript and web resources, and similar tasks.

## Defining the PHY

Phy handlers are derived from the base `kis_phy_handler` class.

At a minimum a new phy must provide (and override):

* The basic C++ constructor and destructor implementations
* The create function to build an actual instance of the phy handler
* A common classifier stage to create common info from the custom packet info
* A storage loader function to attach any custom data when a device is loaded from storage

## Loading from storage and custom data types

A new phy will almost certainly define a custom tracked data type - `dot11_tracked_device` and `bluetooth_tracked_device` for instance.  As part of defining this custom type, the phy must provide a storage loader function to import stored data into a proper object.

In addition, there are some specific pitfalls when loading custom objects - be sure to check the  "Restoring vector and map objects" section of of the `tracked_component` docs!

Currently storage code is not used, but may be leveraged in the future.

## Handling the DLT

A datasource which is packet-based but does not conform to an existing DLT defined in Kismet will often need to provide its own DLT handler.

### Do I need a custom DLT handler?

If data records are entirely parsed by the classifier (see below for more information), then a separate DLT handler may not be necessary, however if your DLT embeds signal, location, or other information which needs to be made available to other Kismet data handlers, it should be decoded by your DLT handler.

Capture sources implementing alternate capture methods for known DLTs (for instance, support for 802.11 on other operating systems, etc.) do not need to implement a new DLT handler.

### Deriving the DLT

Kismet DLT handlers are derived from `kis_dlt_handler` from `kis_dlt.h`.  A DLT handler needs to override the constructor and the `handle_packet(...)` functions:

```c++
class dlt_example : public kis_dlt_handler {
public:
    dlt_example();

    virtual int handle_packet(std::shared_ptr<kis_packet> in_pack) override;
};

dlt_example::dlt_example() :
    kis_dlt_handler() {

    // Packet components and insertion into the packetchain is handled
    // automatically by the Kis_DLT_Handler constructor.  All that needs
    // to happen here is setting the name and DLT type
    dlt_name = "Example DLT";

    // DLT type is set in tcpdump.h
    dlt = DLT_SOME_EXAMPLE;

    // Optionally, announce that we're loaded
    _MSG_INFO("Registering support for DLT_SOME_EXAMPLE");
}

// handle_packet(...) is called by the packet chain with the packet data
// as reported by the datasource.  This may already include GPS and signal
// information, as well as the actual link data frame.

// HandlePacket is responsible for decapsulating the DLT, creating any
// additional kis_packet records, and prepping the data for the classifier
// stage.

int dlt_example::handle_packet(std::shared_ptr<kis_packet> in_pack) {
    // Example sanity check - do we already have packet data
    // decapsulated?  For a type like radiotap or PPI that encodes another
    // DLT, this encapsulated chunk might be handled differently
    auto decapchunk = in_pack->fetch_as<kis_datachunk>(pack_comp_decap);

    if (decapchunk != nullptr) {
        return 1;
    }

    // Get the linklayer data record
    auto linkdata = in_pack->fetch_as<kis_datachunk>(pack_comp_linkframe);

    // Sanity check - do we even have a link chunk?
    if (linkdata == nullptr) {
        return 1;
    }

    // Sanity check - does the DLT match?
    if (linkdata->dlt != dlt) {
        return 1;
    }

    // Other code goes here
}
```

## Manipulating packet data

It is important to minimize copying of packet data whenever possible.  While sometimes unavoidable, many manipulations of packet data are simply removing headers and trailing data from the record.

Kismet uses a multi-C++ version of `stringview` via the `nonstd::stringview` library.  This should be used to manipulate the windowed views of packet data, and in general, data records in a packet are all views of the same initial packet data from the IPC protocol.  For example, the following code is used in the Radiotap DLT:

```c++
    auto decapchunk = packetchain->new_packet_component<kis_datachunk>();
    ...
	decapchunk->dlt = KDLT_IEEE802_11;
    ...
    decapchunk->set_data(linkchunk->substr(offset, linkchunk->length() - offset - fcs_cut));
    ...
	in_pack->insert(pack_comp_decap, decapchunk);
```

Using the `stringview` `substr` function keeps us from copying data unnecessarily.

## Minimizing memory allocations

The packet handling loop is an extremely commonly used loop, where small changes can have large impacts.  To minimize thrashing the memory allocation system, Kismet uses object pools for the packet components.  Notice the following code:

```c++
    auto decapchunk = packetchain->new_packet_component<kis_datachunk>();
```

This uses the packetchain object pool for packet components.  If there is a returned object in the pool, it will be reset and returned; if the pool is exhausted, a new object will be created and returned.  Objects created this way are automatically returned to the pool at the end of their lifetime.

## Handling Non-Packet Data

Non-packet data can be decapsulated by extending the `KisDataSource::handle_packet` method.  By default this method handles defined packet types; an extended version should first call the parent instance.

```C++
void some_data_source::handle_packet(string in_type, KVmap in_kvmap) {
    KisDataSource::handle_packet(in_type, in_kvmap);

    string ltype = StrLower(in_type);

    if (ltype == "customtype") {
        handle_packet_custom(in_kvmap);
    }
}
```

Extended information can be added to a packet as a custom record and transmitted via the Kismet packetchain, or can be injected directly into the tracker for the new phy type (See the [tracked components](/docs/dev/tracked_components/) docs for more information).  Injecting into the packet chain allows existing Kismet code to track signal levels, location, etc., automatically.

If the incoming data is directly injected into the data tracking system for the new phy type, then special care must be taken to create pseudo-packet records for the core device-tracking system.  Ultimately, a pseudo-packet event must be created, either when processing the custom IPC packet or in the device classifier.  Generally, it is recommended that a datasource attach the custom record to a packet object and process it via the packetchain as documented in the [tracked components](/docs/dev/tracked_components/) docs.

When processing a custom frame, existing KV pair handlers can be used.  For example:

```C++
void some_data_source::handle_packet_custom(KVmap in_kvpairs) {
    KVmap::iterator i;

    // We inject into the packetchain so we need to make a packet
    kis_packet *packet = NULL;

    // We accept signal and gps info in our custom IPC packet
    kis_layer1_packinfo *siginfo = NULL;
    kis_gps_packinfo *gpsinfo = NULL;

    // We accept messages, so process them using the existin message KV
    // handler
    if ((i = in_kvpairs.find("message")) != in_kvpairs.end()) {
        handle_kv_message(i->second);
    }

    // Generate a packet using the packetchain
    packet = packetchain->GeneratePacket();

    // Gather signal data if we have any
    if ((i = in_kvpairs.find("signal")) != in_kvpairs.end()) {
        siginfo = handle_kv_signal(i->second);
    }

    // Gather GPS data if we have any
    if ((i = in_kvpairs.find("gps")) != in_kvpairs.end()) {
        gpsinfo = handle_kv_gps(i->second);
    }

    // Add them to the packet
    if (siginfo != NULL) {
        packet->insert(pack_comp_l1info, siginfo);
    }

    if (gpsinfo != NULL) {
        packet->insert(pack_comp_gps, gpsinfo);
    }

    // Gather whatever custom data we have and add it to the packet
    if ((i = in_kvpairs.find("customfoo")) != in_kvpairs.end()) {
        handle_kv_customfoo(i->second, packet);
    }

    // Update the last valid report time
    inc_num_reports(1);
    set_last_report_time(globalreg->timestamp.tv_sec);

    // Inject the packet into the packet chain, this will clean up
    // the packet when it's done with it automatically.
    packetchain->processPacket(packet);
}
```
