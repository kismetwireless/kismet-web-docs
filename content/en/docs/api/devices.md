A device is the central record of a tracked entity in Kismet.  Clients, bridges, access points, wireless sensors, and every other type of entity seen by Kismet will ultimately be a device.

Each PHY layer will add fields to the device record and populate the common fields.

For complex relationships (such as 802.11 Wi-Fi), a list of related devices in the device record describes the access point-client relationship, shared hardware, etc.

All devices will have a basic set of records (held in the `kismet.base.foo` group of fields, generally) and sub-trees of records attached by the phy-specific handlers.  A device may have multiple phy-specific records, for instance a device may contain both a `device.dot11` record and a `device.uav` record if it is seen to be a Wi-Fi based UAV/Drone device.

Some care must be taken when requesting large numbers of device records:  Kismet may be tracking tens or hundreds of thousands of devices in a single session, and requesting *all* devices can run both the Kismet server and your UI out of resources.

Whenever possible, use the pagination functions of the [device view](/docs/api/device_views/) API and request devices groups.

Since the `2019-06` release, Kismet has migrated most device interactions to the device view api.  Any new users of the API should use the device views.
