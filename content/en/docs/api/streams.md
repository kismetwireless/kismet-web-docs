Kismet considers anything logging a continual egress of data to be a "stream".

The primary set of streams includes packet logging to PCAP files or to web endpoints.

Streams can be viewed and manipulated, for instance a client pulling a packet endpoint can either cancel the open connection, or issue a stream close command via the stream API.
